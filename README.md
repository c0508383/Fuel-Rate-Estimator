This is a small JavaScript application I made with 2 other classmates as my Software Design semester project. It's a fuel rate estimator that calculates quotes based on an input location, previous quote history, etc.

The project can be hosted by a server on your local machine using NodeJS, and all the necessary libraries must first be installed.

The server connects to a database on MongoDB which is no longer hosted by me, but you can add your own database using Mongo in the mongoose.js file located under ./models/mongoose.js.
